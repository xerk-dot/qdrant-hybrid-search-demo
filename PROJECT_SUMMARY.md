# Project #4: Semantic Search on Structured and Unstructured Data

## 🎯 Project Complete - Ready for Presentation!

### **What We Built**
A comprehensive e-commerce search demo that combines semantic vector search with structured metadata filtering using Qdrant. The system demonstrates hybrid search capabilities that go beyond traditional keyword matching.

## 🎯 Key Features Demonstrated

### **1. Semantic Understanding**
- Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` sentence transformer (384 dimensions)
- Understands "comfortable shoes" = "cozy footwear" = "soft sneakers"
- Combines title + description + category + tags for rich embeddings

### **2. Hybrid Search**
- Vector similarity search through Qdrant
- Structured filtering on price, category, brand, rating
- Natural language query parsing (e.g., "under $1000" → price filter)

### **3. Custom Business Logic**
- Weighted scoring: 70% semantic + 20% rating + 10% popularity
- Availability penalties (out of stock = 50% score reduction)
- Title/brand match bonuses for precise queries

### **4. Rich Demo Interface**
- Interactive Streamlit web app
- Real-time search with filter options
- Visual analytics (score breakdown, price vs rating plots)
- Sample queries and suggestions

---

## 📊 Demo Dataset

- **Size:** 1,000 realistic e-commerce products
- **Categories:** Electronics, Clothing, Sports & Outdoors, Home & Garden
- **Metadata:** Price, brand, rating, reviews, availability, specifications
- **Variety:** Multiple brands, price ranges, and product types

---

## 🎤 Presentation Ready Elements

### **Compelling Demo Queries:**
1. `"comfortable running shoes"` - Basic semantic search
2. `"gaming laptop under $1000"` - Hybrid with price filter
3. `"wireless noise canceling headphones"` - Multi-term semantic
4. `"highly rated fitness tracker"` - Business logic scoring

### **Visual Story Elements:**
- Before/after search relevance comparison
- Scoring breakdown charts
- Real-time filtering and suggestions
- Performance metrics display

### **Technical Talking Points:**
- Qdrant payload indexing advantages
- Vector + metadata atomic queries
- Custom scoring flexibility
- Real-time update capabilities

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### **Why This Approach Works:**
- **Single System:** No separate vector DB + metadata DB
- **Atomic Queries:** Vector search + filtering in one operation
- **Performance:** HNSW index for sub-linear search scaling
- **Flexibility:** Easy to tune scoring weights and add new filters

### **Production Ready Features:**
- Batch embedding generation
- Error handling and logging
- Docker containerization
- Health checks and verification

---

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### **Performance:**
- Current: Sub-100ms search on 1K products
- Scale: Can handle millions with quantization
- Updates: Real-time via Qdrant upsert operations

### **Memory Optimization:**
- Binary quantization: 32x smaller vectors
- Product quantization: 4-16x reduction
- Disk-based storage for large catalogs
